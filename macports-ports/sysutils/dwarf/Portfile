description         a little and powerful object file manipulation tool
long_description    dwarf-ng is a powerful object file manipulation tools in \
                    the spirit of gdb. With dwarf-ng you can read and edit \
                    all the file's section headers as well as the raw data. \
                    With dwarf-ng you can create and customize new file's \
                    header and it can be used as a compiler back-end to \
                    create executables/object files. dwarf-ng also permits \
                    to inject easily new headers and pieces of code/data \
                    into the file. dwarf-ng currently handles Raw, ELF \
                    (Elf32, Elf64), PE (Portable executables PE32, PE+) and \
                    Mach-O (macOS executables) files formats. In the \
                    future new files type will be added.
