long_description    \
    {*}${description} sudosh is an auditing shell filter and can be used as a \
    login shell. Sudosh records all keystrokes and output and can play back \
    the session as just like a VCR. Sudosh2 is a continuation of the \
    development of sudosh. Sudosh2 is an auditing layer between sudo and a \
    user\'s shell, that can also be used as a login shell. User sessions are \
    recorded and are available for later playback by the system \
    administrator. sudosh2 does not record command history except when \
    executed remotely via ssh\'s command option. If you\'re looking for \
    something to just log commands, there are other tools for that. sudosh2 \
    does not log sessions to syslog. If you need to consolidate session logs \
    to a single location, logging them to a network filesystem is currently \
    the recommended option. sudosh2 was forked from sudosh, which was pulled \
    by its original developer when a commercial company bought it from him. \
    The initial project goals were to fix several major bugs, make it 64 bit \
    safe, and port to newer versions of Unix operating systems. The initial \
    targets were RHEL5 and Solaris 10, but most recent free Unix systems \
    should work perfectly.
