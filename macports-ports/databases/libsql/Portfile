description         \
    Fork of SQLite that is both Open Source, and Open Contributions.

long_description    \
    ${name} is an open source, open contribution fork of SQLite. We aim to \
    evolve it to suit many more use cases than SQLite was originally designed \
    for, and plan to use third-party OSS code wherever it makes sense. \
    ${name} will always be compatible with the SQLite file format. ${name} \
    will keep 100% compatibility with the SQLite API, but we may add \
    additional APIs. SQLite is an embedded database that can be consumed as a \
    single .c file with its accompanying header. ${name} will always be \
    embeddable, meaning it runs inside your process without needing a network \
    connection. But we may change the distribution, so that object files are \
    generated, instead of a single .c file.
