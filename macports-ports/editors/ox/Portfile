description         An independent Rust text editor that runs in your terminal!

long_description    Ox is a code editor. It was written in Rust using ANSI \
                    escape sequences. It assists developers with programming \
                    by providing several tools to speed up and make \
                    programming easier and a refreshing alternative to \
                    heavily bloated and resource hungry editors such as VS \
                    Code and JetBrains. Ox is lightweight so it can be used \
                    on older computers.
